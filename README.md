# Final-Project

The GUI is set up with the x & y values in the top where you
set the x values for the line you are trying to make. It does
not matter if you use parenthesis or commas. All you need is
the numbers seperated with a space. Under that is the lower
upper limits on the x & y plane. It works the same way as above,
all you need to do is just type in a value. Even further under 
that is the fun customization. First you can choose the color 
of your line, then the next part you can customize the look
of your line. In the top right of the GUI is where you can change
the title and the axis titles. In the bottom right is the graph 
that will display the lines you want. To make the code run, you 
need to click the plot button in the far bottom left of the GUI.
Next to that is the clear button which just resets everything
to when you open the GUI.
